      <h2>Google</h2>
      <hr />

      <p>
        Google LLC is an American multinational technology company that
        specializes in Internet-related services and products, which include
        online advertising technologies, a search engine, cloud computing,
        software, and hardware. It is considered one of the Big Five companies
        in the American information technology industry, along with Amazon,
        Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft. Google was founded on September 4, 1998,
        by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford
        University in California.

          <h2>History</h2>
          <hr />
          <h3>Early years</h3>
          <p>
            Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and
            Sergey Brin when they were both PhD students at Stanford University
            in California.[18][19][20] The project initially involved an
            unofficial "third founder", Scott Hassan, the original lead
            programmer who wrote much of the code for the original Google Search
            engine, but he left before Google was officially founded as a
            company;[21][22] Hassan went on to pursue a career in robotics and
            founded the company Willow Garage in 2006. While conventional search
            engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms
            appeared on the page, they theorized about a better system that
            analyzed the relationships among websites.[25] They called this
            algorithm PageRank; it determined a website's relevance by the
            number of pages, and the importance of those pages that linked back
            to the original site.[26][27] Page told his ideas to Hassan, who
            began writing the code to implement Page's ideas.

          <h3>Growth</h3>
          <p>
            In March 1999, the company moved its offices to Palo Alto,
            California,[45] which is home to several prominent Silicon Valley
            technology start-ups.[46] The next year, Google began selling
            advertisements associated with search keywords against Page and
            Brin's initial opposition toward an advertising-funded search
            engine.[47][20] To maintain an uncluttered page design,
            advertisements were solely text-based.[48] In June 2000, it was
            announced that Google would become the default search engine
            provider for Yahoo!, one of the most popular websites at the time,
            replacing Inktomi. In 2003, after outgrowing two other locations,
            the company leased an office complex from Silicon Graphics, at 1600
            Amphitheatre Parkway in Mountain View, California.[52] The complex
            became known as the Googleplex, a play on the word googolplex, the
            number one followed by a googol zeroes. Three years later, Google
            bought the property from SGI for $319 million.[53] By that time, the
            name "Google" had found its way into everyday language, causing the
            verb "google" to be added to the Merriam-Webster Collegiate
            Dictionary and the Oxford English Dictionary, denoted as: "to use
            the Google search engine to obtain information on the
            Internet".[54][55] The first use of the verb on television appeared
            in an October 2002 episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

          <h2>Producs and services</h2>
          <hr />
          <h3>Search engine</h3>
          <p>
            Google indexes billions of web pages to allow users to search for
            the information they desire through the use of keywords and
            operators.[114] According to comScore market research from November
            2009, Google Search is the dominant search engine in the United
            States market, with a market share of 65.6%.[115] In May 2017,
            Google enabled a new "Personal" tab in Google Search, letting users
            search for content in their Google accounts' various services,
            including email messages from Gmail and photos from Google
            Photos.[116][117] Google launched its Google News service in 2002,
            an automated service which summarizes news articles from various
            websites.[118] Google also hosts Google Books, a service which
            searches the text found in books in its database and shows limited
            previews or and the full book where allowed.

          <h3>Advertising</h3>
          <p>
            Google generates most of its revenues from advertising. This
            includes sales of apps, purchases made in-app, digital content
            products on Google and YouTube, Android and licensing and service
            fees, including fees received for Google Cloud offerings. Forty-six
            percent of this profit was from clicks (cost per clicks), amounting
            to US$109,652 million in 2017. This includes three principal
            methods, namely AdMob, AdSense (such as AdSense for Content, AdSense
            for Search, etc.) and DoubleClick AdExchange.

          <h3>Web-base service</h3>
          <p>
            Google offers Gmail for email,[128] Google Calendar for
            time-management and scheduling,[129] Google Maps for mapping,
            navigation and satellite imagery,[130] Google Drive for cloud
            storage of files,[131] Google Docs, Sheets and Slides for
            productivity,[131] Google Photos for photo storage and sharing,[132]
            Google Keep for note-taking,[133] Google Translate for language
            translation,[134] YouTube for video viewing and sharing,[135] Google
            My Business for managing public business information,[136] and Duo
            for social interaction.[137] In March 2019, Google unveiled a cloud
            gaming service named Stadia.[102] A job search product has also
            existed since before 2017,[138][139][140] Google for Jobs is an
            enhanced search feature that aggregates listings from job boards and
            career sites.[141][142] Some Google services are not web-based.
            Google Earth, launched in 2005, allowed users to see high-definition
            satellite pictures from all over the world for free through a client
            software downloaded to their computers.[143]

          <h3>Hardware</h3>
          <p>
            In January 2010, Google released Nexus One, the first Android phone
            under its own brand.[151] It spawned a number of phones and tablets
            under the "Nexus" branding[152] until its eventual discontinuation
            in 2016, replaced by a new brand called Pixel.[153] In 2011, the
            Chromebook was introduced, which runs on Chrome OS.[154] In July
            2013, Google introduced the Chromecast dongle, which allows users to
            stream content from their smartphones to televisions.[155][156] In
            June 2014, Google announced Google Cardboard, a simple cardboard
            viewer that lets user place their smartphone in a special front
            compartment to view virtual reality (VR) media.[157][158] Other
            hardware products include: Nest, a series of voice assistant smart
            speakers that can answer voice queries, play music, find information
            from apps (calendar, weather etc.), and control third-party smart
            home appliances (users can tell it to turn on the lights, for
            example). The Google Nest line includes the original Google
            Home[159] (later succeeded by the Nest Audio), the Google Home Mini
            (later succeeded by the Nest Mini, the Google Home Max, the Google
            Home Hub (later rebranded as the Nest Hub), and the Nest Hub Max.
            Nest Wifi (originally Google Wifi), a connected set of Wi-Fi routers
            to simplify and extend coverage of home Wi-Fi.[160]

          <h2>Corporate affairs</h2>
          <hr />
          <h3>Stock price performance and quarterly earnings</h3>
          <p></p>
          Google's initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004.
          At IPO, the company offered 19,605,052 shares at a price of $85 per
          share.[59][60] The sale of $1.67 billion gave Google a market
          capitalization of more than $23 billion.[63] The stock performed well
          after the IPO, with shares hitting $350 for the first time on October
          31, 2007,[173] primarily because of strong sales and earnings in the
          online advertising market.[174] The surge in stock price was fueled
          mainly by individual investors, as opposed to large institutional
          investors and mutual funds.[174] GOOG shares split into GOOG class C
          shares and GOOGL class A shares.[175] The company is listed on the
          NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbols GOOGL and GOOG, and on
          the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol GGQ1. These
          ticker symbols now refer to Alphabet Inc., Google's holding company,
          since the fourth quarter of 2015.[176]

          <h3>Corporate identify</h3>
          <p>
            The name "Google" originated from a misspelling of
            "googol",[193][194] which refers to the number represented by a 1
            followed by one-hundred zeros. Page and Brin write in their original
            paper on PageRank:[30] "We chose our systems name, Google, because
            it is a common spelling of googol, or 10100 and fits well with our
            goal of building very large-scale search engines." Having found its
            way increasingly into everyday language, the verb "google" was added
            to the Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary and the Oxford English
            Dictionary in 2006, meaning "to use the Google search engine to
            obtain information on the Internet."[195][196] Google's mission
            statement, from the outset, was "to organize the world's information
            and make it universally accessible and useful",[197] and its
            unofficial slogan is "Don't be evil".[198] In October 2015, a
            related motto was adopted in the Alphabet corporate code of conduct
            by the phrase: "Do the right thing".[199] The original motto was
            retained in the code of conduct of Google, now a subsidiary of
            Alphabet. The original Google logo was designed by Sergey Brin.[200]
            Since 1998, Google has been designing special, temporary alternate
            logos to place on their homepage intended to celebrate holidays,
            events, achievements and people. The first Google Doodle was in
            honor of the Burning Man Festival of 1998.[201][202] The doodle was
            designed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin to notify users of their
            absence in case the servers crashed. Subsequent Google Doodles were
            designed by an outside contractor, until Larry and Sergey asked
            then-intern Dennis Hwang to design a logo for Bastille Day in 2000.
            From that point onward, Doodles have been organized and created by a
            team of employees termed "Doodlers".[203] Google has a tradition of
            creating April Fools' Day jokes. Its first on April 1, 2000, was
            Google MentalPlex which allegedly featured the use of mental power
            to search the web.[204] In 2007, Google announced a free Internet
            service called TiSP, or Toilet Internet Service Provider, where one
            obtained a connection by flushing one end of a fiber-optic cable
            down their toilet.
